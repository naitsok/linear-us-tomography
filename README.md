# linear-us-tomography

Solving ultrasound tomogrpahy problem in the linear wave approximation.

The solution consists of the following steps:

1. Solve direct problem using a sample image.
2. Solve the inverse problem (with optionally added noise) and reconstruc the image.

The number of transducers and noise level determine the quality of reconstructed image.
